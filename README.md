# GalaxyStructureTypeAndSurfaceStellarDensity_SDSS
 
This is part of my AP Research. Feel free to use it as you like!

This project uses the stellar mass and radius of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survery in Data Release 18 to calculate the stellar surface density of galaxies and compares the spiral and elliptical galaxies. with each other in terms of the density. The code is in Python.
